## Window Management Functions
**Documentation**: https://nutjs.dev/modules/window
- [x] List all windows
- [x] Get active window
- [x] Get window title
- [x] Get window size and position
- [x] Focus window
- [x] Resize window
- [x] Reposition window
- [-] Minimize window (unsupported in libnut-core)

## Integration Functions
**Documentation**: https://nutjs.dev/modules/integration
- [x] Add clipboard support

  - Supports text operations: get, set, check, clear
- [x] Add support for finding UI elements

## Testing Strategy Implementation

### Unit Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Keyboard module tests
  - Type text functionality
  - Single key press operations
  - Key combinations with proper cleanup
  - Key hold/release operations with timing
- [x] Screen module tests
  - Screen size retrieval
  - Screenshot capture with various options
  - Window management operations
  - Error handling for unsupported operations
- [x] Tools handler tests
  - Tool registration and listing
  - Tool execution with validation
  - Error handling and response formatting
  - Type validation for all inputs

### Integration Testing üîÑ
- [ ] Cross-module interactions
  - Test keyboard + mouse combinations
  - Test window focus + keyboard input
  - Test clipboard + keyboard operations
- [ ] External system interactions
  - [ ] Mock libnut for predictable testing
  - [ ] Real system tests with proper cleanup
  - [ ] Test system state restoration

### Security Testing üîí
- [ ] Input validation
  - [ ] Sanitize window titles and paths
  - [ ] Validate coordinate ranges
  - [ ] Check string input lengths
- [ ] Resource access
  - [ ] Validate clipboard access permissions
  - [ ] Check window access permissions
  - [ ] Monitor system resource usage
- [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Implement input rate limiting
  - [ ] Add cooldown for rapid operations
  - [ ] Monitor and limit resource consumption

### Performance Testing ‚ö°
- [ ] Load testing
  - [ ] Rapid input sequences
  - [ ] Multiple window operations
  - [ ] Large clipboard operations
- [ ] Resource monitoring
  - [ ] Memory usage tracking
  - [ ] CPU utilization checks
  - [ ] Handle resource cleanup
- [ ] Timeout handling
  - [ ] Operation timeouts
  - [ ] Cleanup on timeout
  - [ ] Graceful degradation

### Error Handling üõ†
- [ ] Comprehensive error states
  - [ ] Network disconnection
  - [ ] System resource unavailability
  - [ ] Permission denied scenarios
- [ ] Resource cleanup
  - [ ] Keyboard state restoration
  - [ ] Mouse position cleanup
  - [ ] Window state restoration
- [ ] Error reporting
  - [ ] Detailed error messages
  - [ ] Error categorization
  - [ ] Recovery suggestions

### Implementation Steps for Testing
1. Create test files for each module
2. Implement mock systems for external dependencies
3. Set up test environments with proper isolation
4. Add performance monitoring tools
5. Implement security checks and validations
6. Create cleanup routines for all operations

## Current Implementation Status
### Completed ‚úÖ
- Basic mouse movement and clicking
- Basic keyboard input
- Screen capture and size
- Cursor position tracking
- Basic active window detection (title, size, and position)
- Mouse scrolling (up/down)
- Window management functions (list, focus, resize, reposition)
- Key combinations support
- Clipboard operations (get, set, check, clear)
- Advanced mouse operations (drag, speed control)
- Advanced keyboard operations (key holding/releasing)
- Unit tests for keyboard module
- Unit tests for screen module
- Unit tests for tools handler

### In Progress üîÑ
- Integration testing setup
- Security validation implementation
- Performance monitoring tools
- Error handling improvements

### Pending ‚ùå
- UI element finding
- Window minimize/restore operations (unsupported in libnut-core)
- Complete integration test suite
- Security test implementation
- Performance test suite
- Comprehensive error handling tests

### Unsupported in libnut-core ‚õî
- Advanced screen information (multiple monitors, DPI settings, etc.)
  - Only main display size and capture are supported
  - No built-in support for secondary monitors
  - Would require implementing new methods using platform-specific APIs:
    - Windows: EnumDisplayMonitors()
    - Linux: XRandR extension
    - macOS: NSScreen API
