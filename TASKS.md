## Known Limitations ‚õî
- Advanced screen information (multiple monitors, DPI settings)
  - Only main display supported
  - No built-in multi-monitor support
  - Would require platform-specific implementations:
    - Windows: EnumDisplayMonitors()
    - Linux: XRandR extension
    - macOS: NSScreen API
- Window minimize/restore operations (unsupported in libnut-core)
