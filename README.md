Cross-platform control server for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), providing programmatic control over system operations including mouse, keyboard, window management, and screen capture functionality.

> **Note**: With nutjs as the default provider, MCPControl now supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üì¢ Project Status

MCPControl is **not actively developed** but we welcome bug reports and pull requests from the community. The project is functional and extensible for those who want to contribute or adapt it for their needs.

## üî• Why MCPControl?

MCPControl bridges the gap between AI models and your desktop, enabling secure, programmatic control of:

- üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse movements and clicks**
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard input and shortcuts**
- ü™ü **Window management**
- üì∏ **Screen capture and analysis**
- üìã **Clipboard operations**

## üîå Quick Start

### Prerequisites

> **Critical**: All prerequisites must be installed in the order shown below. The build will fail without these tools.

1. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ Workload** (Required for compiling nutjs)
   ```powershell
   # Run as Administrator - This may take 5-10 minutes to complete
   winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
   # Restart your terminal after installation
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.12+** (Required for node-gyp)
   ```powershell
   # Install Python and ensure it's added to PATH
   winget install Python.Python.3.12
   # Verify installation: python --version
   ```

3. **Install Node.js 18+** (LTS version recommended)
   ```powershell
   # Install Node.js LTS
   winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
   # Verify installation: node --version
   ```

4. **Install Global Build Tools**
   ```powershell
   # Install required npm global packages
   npm install -g node-gyp cmake-js
   ```

### Installation

> **Important**: MCPControl is not published to npm because the nutjs dependency requires compilation from source with platform-specific build tools. You must build from source.

1. **Clone and Build from Source**
   ```powershell
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/claude-did-this/MCPControl.git
   cd MCPControl
   
   # Install dependencies (this will compile nutjs)
   npm install
   
   # Build the TypeScript project
   npm run build
   
   # Run directly
   node build/index.js --sse
   ```

### Configuration

MCPControl works best in a **virtual machine at 1280x720 resolution** for optimal click accuracy.

Configure your Claude client to connect to MCPControl via SSE transport:

#### Option 1: Direct SSE Connection

For connecting to an MCPControl server running on a VM or remote machine:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCPControl": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://192.168.1.100:3232/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `192.168.1.100:3232` with your server's IP address and port.

#### Option 2: Local Launch with SSE

To launch MCPControl locally with SSE transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCPControl": {
      "command": "mcp-control",
      "args": ["--sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Starting the Server

First, start the MCPControl server on your VM or local machine:

```bash
mcp-control --sse
```

The server will display:
- Available network interfaces and their IP addresses
- The port number (default: 3232)
- Connection status messages

### VM Setup Example

1. **Start your Windows VM** with 1280x720 resolution
2. **Build MCPControl** on the VM (see Installation section above)
3. **Run the server** with SSE transport:
   ```bash
   mcp-control --sse
   ```
4. **Note the VM's IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
5. **Configure Claude** with the SSE URL:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "MCPControl": {
         "transport": "sse",
         "url": "http://192.168.1.100:3232/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
6. **Restart Claude** and MCPControl will appear in your MCP menu!

## üîß CLI Options

MCPControl supports several command-line flags for advanced configurations:

```bash
# Run with SSE transport on default port (3232)
mcp-control --sse

# Run with SSE on custom port
mcp-control --sse --port 3000

# Run with HTTPS/TLS (required for production deployments)
mcp-control --sse --https --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem

# Run with HTTPS on custom port
mcp-control --sse --https --port 8443 --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--sse` - Enable SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport for network access
- `--port [number]` - Specify custom port (default: 3232)
- `--https` - Enable HTTPS/TLS (required for remote deployments per MCP spec)
- `--cert [path]` - Path to TLS certificate file (required with --https)
- `--key [path]` - Path to TLS private key file (required with --https)

### Security Note

According to the MCP specification, HTTPS is **mandatory** for all HTTP-based transports in production environments. When deploying MCPControl for remote access, always use the `--https` flag with valid TLS certificates.

## üîß Automation Providers

MCPControl supports multiple automation providers for different use cases:

- **nutjs** (default) - Cross-platform automation library (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **powershell** - Windows PowerShell-based automation (Windows only)
- **autohotkey** - AutoHotkey v2 scripting (Windows only)

### Extensibility

MCPControl is designed to be extensible with custom automation providers. You can create providers for:

- **macOS** - Using AppleScript, Accessibility APIs, or libraries like robotjs
- **Linux** - Using X11/Wayland APIs, xdotool, or similar automation tools
- **Custom Solutions** - Any automation library that can implement the provider interface

To add a new provider, implement the `AutomationProvider` interface in `src/interfaces/provider.ts`. See existing providers in `src/providers/` for examples.

### Provider Configuration

You can configure the automation provider using environment variables:

```bash
# Use a specific provider for all operations
export AUTOMATION_PROVIDER=autohotkey

# Configure AutoHotkey executable path (if not in PATH)
export AUTOHOTKEY_PATH="C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\v2\AutoHotkey.exe"
```

Or use modular configuration for specific operations:

```bash
# Mix and match providers for different operations
export AUTOMATION_KEYBOARD_PROVIDER=autohotkey
export AUTOMATION_MOUSE_PROVIDER=nutjs
export AUTOMATION_SCREEN_PROVIDER=nutjs  
export AUTOMATION_CLIPBOARD_PROVIDER=powershell
```

See provider-specific documentation:
- [AutoHotkey Provider](src/providers/autohotkey/README.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

If you're interested in contributing or building from source, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.

### Development Requirements

To build this project for development, you'll need:

1. Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
2. Node.js 18 or later (install using the official Windows installer which includes build tools)
3. npm package manager
4. Native build tools:
   - node-gyp: `npm install -g node-gyp`
   - cmake-js: `npm install -g cmake-js`

The nutjs dependency relies on native modules that require these build tools. Since nutjs doesn't provide prebuilt binaries in the free version, it will compile from source during npm install. This is why MCPControl cannot be distributed as a pre-built npm package - each user must compile the native dependencies for their specific system.
